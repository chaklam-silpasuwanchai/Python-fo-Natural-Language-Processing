    "A dependency parser analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between head words, and words which modify those heads.  There are multiple types of dependency parsers, including transition-based parsers, graph-based parsers, and feature-based parsers.  Your implementation will be a transition-based parser, which incrementally builds up a parse one step at a time.  At every step, it maintains a partial parse, which is represented as follows:\n",

At each step, the parser applies a tranistion to the partial parse until its buffer is empty and the stack size is 1.  The following transitions can be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\texttt{SHIFT}$: removes the first word from the buffer and pushes it onto the stack.\n",

They can be represented as a list of integers $\\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\cdots, w_m]$ where $m$ is the number of features and each $0 \\leq w_i \\leq |V|$ is the index of a token in the vocabulary ($|V|$ is the vocabulary size).  Then our network looks up an embedding for each word and concatenates them into a single input vector:\n",
