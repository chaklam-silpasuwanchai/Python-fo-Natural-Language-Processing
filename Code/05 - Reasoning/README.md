## Papers on advanced prompting to improve reasoning
- [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903): Using few-shot prompts to ask models to think step by step improves their reasoning. PaLM's score on math word problems (GSM8K) rises from 18% to 57%.
- [Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171): Taking votes from multiple outputs improves accuracy even more. Voting across 40 outputs raises PaLM's score on math word problems further, from 57% to 74%, and code-davinci-002's from 60% to 78%.
- [Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601): Searching over trees of step by step reasoning helps even more than voting over chains of thought. It lifts GPT-4's scores on creative writing and crosswords.
- [Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916): Telling instruction-following models to think step by step improves their reasoning. It lifts text-davinci-002's score on math word problems (GSM8K) from 13% to 41%.
- [Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910): Automated searching over possible prompts found a prompt that lifts scores on math word problems (GSM8K) to 43%, 2 percentage points above the human-written prompt in Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners.
- [Reprompting: Automated Chain-of-Thought Prompt Inference Through Gibbs Sampling (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09993): Automated searching over possible chain-of-thought prompts improved ChatGPT's scores on a few benchmarks by 0â€“20 percentage points.
- [Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14271): Reasoning can be improved by a system that combines: chains of thought generated by alternative selection and inference prompts, a halter model that chooses when to halt selection-inference loops, a value function to search over multiple reasoning paths, and sentence labels that help avoid hallucination.
- [STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465): Chain of thought reasoning can be baked into models via fine-tuning. For tasks with an answer key, example chains of thoughts can be generated by language models.
- [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629): For tasks with tools or an environment, chain of thought works better if you prescriptively alternate between Reasoning steps (thinking about what to do) and Acting (getting information from a tool or environment).
- [Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366): Retrying tasks with memory of prior failures improves subsequent performance.
- [Demonstrate-Search-Predict: Composing retrieval and language models for knowledge-intensive NLP (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14024): Models augmented with knowledge via a "retrieve-then-read" can be improved with multi-hop chains of searches.
- [Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325): Generating debates between a few ChatGPT agents over a few rounds improves scores on various benchmarks. Math word problem scores rise from 77% to 85%.
