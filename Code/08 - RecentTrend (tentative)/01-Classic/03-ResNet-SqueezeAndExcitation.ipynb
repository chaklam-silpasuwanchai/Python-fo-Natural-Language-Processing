    "The ResNet CNN, which is still very popular as a baseline model today, was first described in [the ResNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). Prior to ResNet, there were many difficulties building very deep neural networks. First, an ordinary convolutional layer, when it is first initialized with small random weights, basically scrambles its input. Activation functions like sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents, and ReLU quash gradients during backpropagation for patterns with activations falling in the near 0 or 0 region of the activation function. This is called the *vanishing gradient* problem, the effect of which increases with network depth. This problem can be solved with batch normalization and other normalization techniques to allow DNNs trained by SGD to extend to 10's of layers. However, practitioners found other problems that occur when we go beyond 10-20 layers: the problem of *degradation*, in which training error decreases with additional network depth to a point, then starts to *increase*. To address the degredation issue to the point that we can build models with hundreds of layers, the Microsoft Research ResNet team introduced a mechanism for shortcut connections that prevents the scrambling of effect of newly initialized layers by bypassing them, allowing undegraded gradient information to be efficiently backpropagated to the earliest layers of the model.\n",
