    "# [Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models through Question Complexity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14403)\n",
    "\n",
    "It addresses the limitations of traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing a classifier that routes queries into three different execution paths based on complexity:\n",
    "- Single-Step (Simple Queries): For straightforward questions like \"When is Michael Phelps' birthday?\", the model performs a single retrieval step to find the answer.\n",
    "- Multi-Step (Complex Queries): For multi-hop questions like \"What is the currency of Billy Giles' birthplace?\", the model performs iterative retrieval ($k$ times) to gather intermediate facts before answering.\n",
    "- No Retrieval (Straightforward Queries): For common knowledge (e.g., \"Paris is the capital of what?\"), the LLM answers directly without searching documents to save time and resources.\n",
