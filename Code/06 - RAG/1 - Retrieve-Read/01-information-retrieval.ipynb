    "**Term Frequency (TF) :** Suppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to rank which document is most relevant to the query , “Data Science is awesome !” A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words “Data”,”is”, “Science”, and “awesome”, but this still leaves many documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "tf(t, d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Frequency :**\n",
    "This measures the importance of document in whole set of corpus, this is very similar to TF. The only difference is that TF is frequency counter for a term t in document d, where as DF is the count of occurrences of term t in the document set N. In other words, DF is the number of documents in which the word is present. We consider one occurrence if the term consists in the document at least once, we do not need to know the number of times the term is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "df(t) = occurrence of t in N documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse Document Frequency(IDF):**\n",
    "While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as “is”, “of”, and “that”, may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing IDF, an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely. IDF is the inverse of the document frequency which measures the informativeness of term t. When we calculate IDF, it will be very low for the most occurring words such as stop words (because stop words such as “is” is present in almost all of the documents, and N/df will give a very low value to that word). This finally gives what we want, a relative weightage.\n",
    "\n",
    "idf(t) = N/df\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are few other problems with the IDF , in case of a large corpus,say 100,000,000 , the IDF value explodes , to avoid the effect we take the log of idf . During the query time, when a word which is not in vocab occurs, the df will be 0. As we cannot divide by 0, we smoothen the value by adding 1 to the denominator. that’s the final formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "idf(t) = log(N/(df + 1))\n",
    "\n",
