    "# Code generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we’ve mostly been using pretrained models and fine-tuning them for new use cases by reusing the weights from pretraining. This is commonly referred to as transfer learning, and it’s a very successful strategy for applying Transformer models to most real-world use cases where labeled data is sparse. In this chapter, we’ll take a different approach and train a completely new model from scratch. This is a good approach to take if you have a lot of data and it is very different from the pretraining data used for the available models. However, it also requires considerably more compute resources to pretrain a language model than just to fine-tune an existing one. Examples where it can make sense to train a new model include for datasets consisting of musical notes, molecular sequences such as DNA, or programming languages. The latter have recently gained traction thanks to tools such as TabNine and GitHub’s Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s Codex model, that can generate long sequences of code. This task of text generation is best addressed with auto-regressive or causal language models such as GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will build a scaled-down version of a code generation model: we’ll focus on one-line completions instead of full functions or classes, using a subset of Python code. When working with data in Python you are in frequent contact with the Python data science stack, consisting of the `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. When using those frameworks it’s common to need to look up specific commands, so it would be nice if we could use a model to complete these calls for us."

Because of the dataset’s size, we want to avoid downloading it; instead, we’ll use the streaming feature to filter it on the fly.

If it is important for your application to have more context (for example, if you want the model to write unit tests based on a file with the function definition), make sure you increase that number, but also keep in mind that this comes with a greater GPU memory footprint. For now, let’s fix the context size at 128 tokens, as opposed to the 1,024 or 2,048 used in GPT-2 or GPT-3, respectively.\n",

If these are each represented as a single token, we can easily check if they occur in the input sequence. Tokens can have a whitespace prefix, so we’ll also check for those versions in the tokenizer vocabulary. To verify that it works, we’ll add one test token which should be split into multiple tokens:"

    "Great, that seems to work nicely! We can now write a custom loss function that takes the input sequence, the logits, and the key tokens we just selected as inputs. First we need to align the logits and inputs: the input sequence shifted by one to the right forms the labels, since the next token is the label for the current token. We can achieve this by starting the labels from the second token of the input sequence, since the model does not make a prediction for the first token anyway. Then we cut off the last logit, as we don’t have a label for the token that follows the full input sequence. With that we can compute the loss per sample and count the occurrences of all keywords in each sample. Finally, we calculate the weighted average over all samples using the occurrences as weights. Since we don’t want to throw away all the samples that have no keywords, we add 1 to the weights:"
