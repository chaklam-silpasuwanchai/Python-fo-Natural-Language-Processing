    "## 1. Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) was initially developed as an algorithm to compress texts, and then used by OpenAI for tokenization when pretraining the GPT model. It’s used by a lot of Transformer models, including GPT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, BART, and DeBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Training algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "BPE training starts by computing the unique set of words used in the corpus (after the normalization and pre-tokenization steps are completed), then building the vocabulary by taking all the symbols used to write those words. As a very simple example, let’s say our corpus uses these five words:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"hug\", \"pug\", \"pun\", \"bun\", \"hugs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The base vocabulary will then be [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\"]. For real-world cases, that base vocabulary will contain all the ASCII characters, at the very least, and probably some Unicode characters as well. If an example you are tokenizing uses a character that is not in the training corpus, that character will be converted to the unknown token. That’s one reason why lots of NLP models are very bad at analyzing content with emojis, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 and RoBERTa tokenizers (which are pretty similar) have a clever way to deal with this: they don’t look at words as being written with Unicode characters, but with bytes. This way the base vocabulary has a small size (256), but every character you can think of will still be included and not end up being converted to the unknown token. This trick is called byte-level BPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting this base vocabulary, we add new tokens until the desired vocabulary size is reached by learning merges, which are rules to merge two elements of the existing vocabulary together into a new one. So, at the beginning these merges will create tokens with two characters, and then, as training progresses, longer subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any step during the tokenizer training, the BPE algorithm will search for the most frequent pair of existing tokens (by “pair,” here we mean two consecutive tokens in a word). That most frequent pair is the one that will be merged, and we rinse and repeat for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our previous example, let’s assume the words had the following frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning \"hug\" was present 10 times in the corpus, \"pug\" 5 times, \"pun\" 12 times, \"bun\" 4 times, and \"hugs\" 5 times. We start the training by splitting each word into characters (the ones that form our initial vocabulary) so we can see each word as a list of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"h\" \"u\" \"g\", 10), (\"p\" \"u\" \"g\", 5), (\"p\" \"u\" \"n\", 12), (\"b\" \"u\" \"n\", 4), (\"h\" \"u\" \"g\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we look at pairs. The pair (\"h\", \"u\") is present in the words \"hug\" and \"hugs\", so 15 times total in the corpus. It’s not the most frequent pair, though: that honor belongs to (\"u\", \"g\"), which is present in \"hug\", \"pug\", and \"hugs\", for a grand total of 20 times in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first merge rule learned by the tokenizer is (\"u\", \"g\") -> \"ug\", which means that \"ug\" will be added to the vocabulary, and the pair should be merged in all the words of the corpus. At the end of this stage, the vocabulary and corpus look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\"]\n",
    "    Corpus: (\"h\" \"ug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"u\" \"n\", 12), (\"b\" \"u\" \"n\", 4), (\"h\" \"ug\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now we have some pairs that result in a token longer than two characters: the pair (\"h\", \"ug\"), for instance (present 15 times in the corpus). The most frequent pair at this stage is (\"u\", \"n\"), however, present 16 times in the corpus, so the second merge rule learned is (\"u\", \"n\") -> \"un\". Adding that to the vocabulary and merging all existing occurrences leads us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\", \"un\"]\n",
    "    Corpus: (\"h\" \"ug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"un\", 12), (\"b\" \"un\", 4), (\"h\" \"ug\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now the most frequent pair is (\"h\", \"ug\"), so we learn the merge rule (\"h\", \"ug\") -> \"hug\", which gives us our first three-letter token. After the merge, the corpus looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\", \"un\", \"hug\"]\n",
    "    Corpus: (\"hug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"un\", 12), (\"b\" \"un\", 4), (\"hug\" \"s\", 5)\n",

    "## 2. WordPiece tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT. It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It’s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Training algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like ## for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, \"word\" gets split like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    w ##o ##r ##d\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    score=(freq_of_pair)/(freq_of_first_element×freq_of_second_element)\n",
    "\n",
    "By dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary. For instance, it won’t necessarily merge (\"un\", \"##able\") even if that pair occurs very frequently in the vocabulary, because the two pairs \"un\" and \"##able\" will likely each appear in a lot of other words and have a high frequency. In contrast, a pair like (\"hu\", \"##gging\") will probably be merged faster (assuming the word “hugging” appears often in the vocabulary) since \"hu\" and \"##gging\" are likely to be less frequent individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the same vocabulary we used in the BPE training example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The splits here will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"h\" \"##u\" \"##g\", 10), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##g\", 5), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 12), (\"b\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 4), (\"h\" \"##u\" \"##g\" \"##s\", 5)\n",
    "    \n",
    "so the initial vocabulary will be [\"b\", \"h\", \"p\", \"##g\", \"##n\", \"##s\", \"##u\"] (if we forget about special tokens for now). The most frequent pair is (\"##u\", \"##g\") (present 20 times), but the individual frequency of \"##u\" is very high, so its score is not the highest (it’s 1 / 36). All pairs with a \"##u\" actually have that same score (1 / 36), so the best score goes to the pair (\"##g\", \"##s\") — the only one without a \"##u\" — at 1 / 20, and the first merge learned is (\"##g\", \"##s\") -> (\"##gs\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we merge, we remove the ## between the two tokens, so we add \"##gs\" to the vocabulary and apply the merge in the words of the corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"h\", \"p\", \"##g\", \"##n\", \"##s\", \"##u\", \"##gs\"]\n",
    "    Corpus: (\"h\" \"##u\" \"##g\", 10), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##g\", 5), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 12), (\"b\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 4), (\"h\" \"##u\" \"##gs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, \"##u\" is in all the possible pairs, so they all end up with the same score. Let’s say that in this case, the first pair is merged, so (\"h\", \"##u\") -> \"hu\". This takes us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"h\", \"p\", \"##g\", \"##n\", \"##s\", \"##u\", \"##gs\", \"hu\"]\n",
    "    Corpus: (\"hu\" \"##g\", 10), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##g\", 5), (\"p\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 12), (\"b\" \"##u\" \"##n\", 4), (\"hu\" \"##gs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the next best score is shared by (\"hu\", \"##g\") and (\"hu\", \"##gs\") (with 1/15, compared to 1/21 for all the other pairs), so the first pair with the biggest score is merged:\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.2 Tokenization algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization differs in WordPiece and BPE in that WordPiece only saves the final vocabulary, not the merge rules learned. Starting from the word to tokenize, WordPiece finds the longest subword that is in the vocabulary, then splits on it. For instance, if we use the vocabulary learned in the example above, for the word \"hugs\" the longest subword starting from the beginning that is inside the vocabulary is \"hug\", so we split there and get [\"hug\", \"##s\"]. We then continue with \"##s\", which is in the vocabulary, so the tokenization of \"hugs\" is [\"hug\", \"##s\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "With BPE, we would have applied the merges learned in order and tokenized this as [\"hu\", \"##gs\"], so the encoding is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, let’s see how the word \"bugs\" would be tokenized. \"b\" is the longest subword starting at the beginning of the word that is in the vocabulary, so we split there and get [\"b\", \"##ugs\"]. Then \"##u\" is the longest subword starting at the beginning of \"##ugs\" that is in the vocabulary, so we split there and get [\"b\", \"##u, \"##gs\"]. Finally, \"##gs\" is in the vocabulary, so this last list is the tokenization of \"bugs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When the tokenization gets to a stage where it’s not possible to find a subword in the vocabulary, the whole word is tokenized as unknown — so, for instance, \"mug\" would be tokenized as [\"[UNK]\"], as would \"bum\" (even if we can begin with \"b\" and \"##u\", \"##m\" is not the vocabulary, and the resulting tokenization will just be [\"[UNK]\"], not [\"b\", \"##u\", \"[UNK]\"]). This is another difference from BPE, which would only classify the individual characters not in the vocabulary as unknown.\n",

    "## 3. Unigram tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unigram algorithm is often used in SentencePiece, which is the tokenization algorithm used by models like AlBERT, T5, mBART, Big Bird, and XLNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Training algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to BPE and WordPiece, Unigram works in the other direction: it starts from a big vocabulary and removes tokens from it until it reaches the desired vocabulary size. There are several options to use to build that base vocabulary: we can take the most common substrings in pre-tokenized words, for instance, or apply BPE on the initial corpus with a large vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of the training, the Unigram algorithm computes a loss over the corpus given the current vocabulary. Then, for each symbol in the vocabulary, the algorithm computes how much the overall loss would increase if the symbol was removed, and looks for the symbols that would increase it the least. Those symbols have a lower effect on the overall loss over the corpus, so in a sense they are “less needed” and are the best candidates for removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all a very costly operation, so we don’t just remove the single symbol associated with the lowest loss increase, but the \n",
    "p (p being a hyperparameter you can control, usually 10 or 20) percent of the symbols associated with the lowest loss increase. This process is then repeated until the vocabulary has reached the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we never remove the base characters, to make sure any word can be tokenized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is still a bit vague: the main part of the algorithm is to compute a loss over the corpus and see how it changes when we remove some tokens from the vocabulary, but we haven’t explained how to do this yet. This step relies on the tokenization algorithm of a Unigram model, so we’ll dive into this next.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll reuse the corpus from the previous examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "and for this example, we will take all strict substrings for the initial vocabulary :\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"h\", \"u\", \"g\", \"hu\", \"ug\", \"p\", \"pu\", \"n\", \"un\", \"b\", \"bu\", \"s\", \"hug\", \"gs\", \"ugs\"]\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.2 Tokenization algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A Unigram model is a type of language model that considers each token to be independent of the tokens before it. It’s the simplest language model, in the sense that the probability of token X given the previous context is just the probability of token X. So, if we used a Unigram language model to generate text, we would always predict the most common token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a given token is its frequency (the number of times we find it) in the original corpus, divided by the sum of all frequencies of all tokens in the vocabulary (to make sure the probabilities sum up to 1). For instance, \"ug\" is present in \"hug\", \"pug\", and \"hugs\", so it has a frequency of 20 in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the frequencies of all the possible subwords in the vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"h\", 15) (\"u\", 36) (\"g\", 20) (\"hu\", 15) (\"ug\", 20) (\"p\", 17) (\"pu\", 17) (\"n\", 16)\n",
    "    (\"un\", 16) (\"b\", 4) (\"bu\", 4) (\"s\", 5) (\"hug\", 15) (\"gs\", 5) (\"ugs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the sum of all frequencies is 210, and the probability of the subword \"ug\" is thus 20/210.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to tokenize a given word, we look at all the possible segmentations into tokens and compute the probability of each according to the Unigram model. Since all tokens are considered independent, this probability is just the product of the probability of each token. For instance, the tokenization [\"p\", \"u\", \"g\"] of \"pug\" has the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P[“p”, “u”, “g”] = 17/210 * 36/210 * 20/210 = 0.00132$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparatively, the tokenization [\"pu\", \"g\"] has the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P[“pu”, “g”] = 17/210 x 20/210 = 0.0077$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so $P[“pu”, “g”]$ is more likely.  In the example of \"pug\", here are the probabilities we would get for each possible segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"p\", \"u\", \"g\"] : 0.00132\n",
    "    [\"p\", \"ug\"] : 0.0077\n",
    "    [\"pu\", \"g\"] : 0.0077\n",
    "\n",
    "So, \"pug\" would be tokenized as [\"p\", \"ug\"] or [\"pu\", \"g\"], depending on which of those segmentations is encountered first (note that in a larger corpus, equality cases like this will be rare).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it was easy to find all the possible segmentations and compute their probabilities, but in general it’s going to be a bit harder. There is a classic algorithm used for this, called the Viterbi algorithm. Essentially, we can build a graph to detect the possible segmentations of a given word by saying there is a branch from character a to character b if the subword from a to b is in the vocabulary, and attribute to that branch the probability of the subword.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the path in that graph that is going to have the best score the Viterbi algorithm determines, for each position in the word, the segmentation with the best score that ends at that position. Since we go from the beginning to the end, that best score can be found by looping through all subwords ending at the current position and then using the best tokenization score from the position this subword begins at. Then, we just have to unroll the path taken to arrive at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at an example using our vocabulary and the word \"unhug\". For each position, the subwords with the best scores ending there are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Character 0 (u): \"u\" (score 0.171429)\n",
    "    Character 1 (n): \"un\" (score 0.076191)\n",
    "    Character 2 (h): \"un\" \"h\" (score 0.005442)\n",
    "    Character 3 (u): \"un\" \"hu\" (score 0.005442)\n",
    "    Character 4 (g): \"un\" \"hug\" (score 0.005442)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Thus \"unhug\" would be tokenized as [\"un\", \"hug\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Back to training\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen how the tokenization works, we can dive a little more deeply into the loss used during training. At any given stage, this loss is computed by tokenizing every word in the corpus, using the current vocabulary and the Unigram model determined by the frequencies of each token in the corpus (as seen before).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word in the corpus has a score, and the loss is the negative log likelihood of those scores — that is, the sum for all the words in the corpus of all the -log(P(word)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go back to our example with the following corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenization of each word with their respective scores is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"hug\": [\"hug\"] (score 0.071428)\n",
    "    \"pug\": [\"pu\", \"g\"] (score 0.007710)\n",
    "    \"pun\": [\"pu\", \"n\"] (score 0.006168)\n",
    "    \"bun\": [\"bu\", \"n\"] (score 0.001451)\n",
    "    \"hugs\": [\"hug\", \"s\"] (score 0.001701)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    10 * (-log(0.071428)) + 5 * (-log(0.007710)) + 12 * (-log(0.006168)) + 4 * (-log(0.001451)) + 5 * (-log(0.001701)) = 169.8\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now we need to compute how removing each token affects the loss. This is rather tedious, so we’ll just do it for two tokens here and save the whole process for when we have code to help us. In this (very) particular case, we had two equivalent tokenizations of all the words: as we saw earlier, for example, \"pug\" could be tokenized [\"p\", \"ug\"] with the same score. Thus, removing the \"pu\" token from the vocabulary will give the exact same loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, removing \"hug\" will make the loss worse, because the tokenization of \"hug\" and \"hugs\" will become:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"hug\": [\"hu\", \"g\"] (score 0.006802)\n",
    "    \"hugs\": [\"hu\", \"gs\"] (score 0.001701)\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes will cause the loss to rise by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 10 * (-log(0.071428)) + 10 * (-log(0.006802)) = 23.5\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, the token \"pu\" will probably be removed from the vocabulary, but not \"hug\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Implementing Unigram\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s implement everything we’ve seen so far in code. Like with BPE and WordPiece, this is not an efficient implementation of the Unigram algorithm (quite the opposite), but it should help you understand it a bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same corpus as before as an example:"
