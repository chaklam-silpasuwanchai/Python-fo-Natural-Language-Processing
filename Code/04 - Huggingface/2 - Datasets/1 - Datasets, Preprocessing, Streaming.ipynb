    "A fast tokenizer with the `batched=True` option is 30 times faster than its slow counterpart with no batching — this is truly amazing! Fast tokenizer is able to achieve such a speedup because behind the scenes the tokenization code is executed in Rust, which is a language that makes it easy to parallelize code execution.  Python is the language most often used for data science and deep learning applications, but when anything needs to be parallelized to be fast, it has to be written in another language. For instance, the matrix multiplications that are at the core of the model computation are written in CUDA, an optimized C library for GPUs.\n",

    "Parallelization is also the reason for the nearly 6x speedup the fast tokenizer achieves with batching: you can’t parallelize a single tokenization operation, but when you want to tokenize lots of texts at the same time you can just split the execution across several processes, each responsible for its own texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Dataset.map()` also has some parallelization capabilities of its own. Since they are not backed by Rust, they won’t let a slow tokenizer catch up with a fast one, but they can still be helpful (especially if you’re using a tokenizer that doesn’t have a fast version). To enable multiprocessing, use the `num_proc` argument and specify the number of processes to use in your call to Dataset.map()"

    "\n",
    "You’ve now seen how 🤗 Datasets can be used to preprocess a dataset in various ways. Although the processing functions of 🤗 Datasets will cover most of your model training needs, there may be times when you’ll need to switch to Pandas to access more powerful features, like `DataFrame.groupby()` or high-level APIs for visualization. Fortunately, 🤗 Datasets is designed to be interoperable with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Let’s take a look at how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the conversion between various third-party libraries, 🤗 Datasets provides a `Dataset.set_format()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, `Dataset.set_format()` changes the return format for the dataset’s __getitem__() dunder method. This means that when we want to create a new object like `train_df` from a Dataset in the \"pandas\" format, we need to slice the whole dataset to obtain a `pandas.DataFrame`. You can verify for yourself that the type of drug_dataset[\"train\"] is Dataset, irrespective of the output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function only changes the output format of the dataset, so you can easily switch to another format without affecting the underlying data format, which is Apache Arrow. The formatting is done in place. To demonstrate, let’s convert our dataset to Pandas:"

I've talked with my doctor about this and he said it is normal but should go away after some time, but it hasn't. Every year around spring time my eyes get terrible irritated  and this year has been the same (maybe even worse than other years) even though I've been using Restasis for a year now.
