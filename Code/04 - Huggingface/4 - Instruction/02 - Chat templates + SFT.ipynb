    "**When to Use Supervised Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use SFT often comes down to the gap between your model's current capabilities and your specific requirements. SFT becomes particularly valuable when you need precise control over the model's outputs or when working in specialized domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're developing a customer service application, you might want your model to consistently follow company guidelines and handle technical queries in a standardized way. Similarly, in medical or legal applications, accuracy and adherence to domain-specific terminology becomes crucial. In these cases, SFT can help align the model's responses with professional standards and domain expertise.\n",

    "The supervised fine-tuning process involves adjusting a model's weights on a task-specific dataset. \n",

The quality of this data is important - each example should demonstrate the kind of output you want your model to produce. Next comes the actual fine-tuning phase, where you'll use frameworks like Hugging Face's `transformers` and `trl` to train the model on your dataset. \n",

    "**The Role of SFT in Preference Alignment**\n",
    "SFT plays a fundamental role in aligning language models with human preferences. Techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on SFT to form a base level of task understanding before further aligning the model’s responses with desired outcomes. Pre-trained models, despite their general language proficiency, may not always generate outputs that match human preferences. SFT bridges this gap by introducing domain-specific data and guidance, which improves the model’s ability to generate responses that align more closely with human expectations.\n",

The library facilitates major processes of RL used in language modelling, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We will use TRL in a number of modules throughout this repo."
