    "Let’s have a quick refresher on the word2vec algorithm. For full details, you may want to rewatch the zoom video we did in our first two lectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight behind word2vec is that *a word is known by the company it keeps*. Concretely, suppose we have a **center** word $c$ and a contextual window. We shall refer to words that lie in this contextual window as **outside words** denoting $o$. For example, in Figure 1 we see that the center word $c$ is *banking*. Since the context window size is 2, the outside words are *turning*, *into*, *crises*, and *as*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the skip-gram word2vec algorithm is to accurately learn the probability distribution $P(O|C)$. Given a specific word $o$ and a specific word $c$, we want to calculate $P (O = o|C = c)$, which is the probability that word $o$ is an *outside* word for $c$, i.e., the probability that $o$ falls within the contextual window of $c$.\n",

    "<img src = \"img/word2vec.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In word2vec, the conditional probability distribution is given by taking vector dot-products and applying the softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P (O = o|C = c) = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\exp({u_o^{T} v_c})}{\\sum_{w \\in V} \\exp({u_w^{T} v_c})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $u_o$ is the *outside* vector representing outside word $o$, and $v_c$ is the *center* vector representing center word $c$. To contain these parameters, we have two matrices, $U$ and $V$ . The columns of $U$ are all the *outside* vectors $u_w$. The columns of $V$ are all of the *center* vectors $v_w$. Both $U$ and $V$ contain a vector for every $w \\in \\text{Vocabulary}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from lectures that, for a single pair of words $c$ and $o$, the loss is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{J}_\\text{naive-softmax}(v_c, o, U) = -\\log P(O=o |C=c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view this loss as the cross-entropy2 between the true distribution $y$ and the predicted distribution $\\hat{y}$. Here, both $y$ and $\\hat{y}$ are vectors with length equal to the number of words in the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the $k$th entry in these vectors indicates the conditional probability of the $k$th word being an *outside word* for the given $c$. The true empirical distribution $y$ is a one-hot vector with a 1 for the true outside word $o$, and $0$ everywhere else. The predicted distribution $\\hat{y}$ is the probability distribution $P (O|C = c)$ given by our model in above equation."
